# Hangman
The project implements a Hangman game using C++ and follows various OOP principles. 

# Code Design
• The code is organized into header and source files, ensuring clear separation of declarations and definitions. The code has no warnings and no memory leaks, being tested with Sanitizers and Valgrind. Build management is facilitated with tools like CMake.

• Amongst the OOP concepts used, some of the featured ones are: basic OOP Principles like encapsulation and inheritance, overloaded and overridden functions, const correctness , exception handling, template classes,
static attributes, design patterns, notably Singleton for managing high scores and Strategy for managing different game modes.

• The code utilizes smart pointers for managing dynamic memory allocation and ensuring proper resource management. Additionally, the code leverages the Standard Template Library (STL) to enhance data structures and algorithms.
